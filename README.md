# fullscreen

**Browser extension for toggling fullscreen on any website.**

This extension provides a minimal interface to the Living Standard [Element.requestFullscreen() Web API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/requestFullScreen), so any page can be toggled to fullscreen.

Unlike other extensions available on extension stores, this extension acts like a typical video-fullscreen operation: it removes titlebars and other browser UI until Esc is pressed. Great for reading online without distractions.
